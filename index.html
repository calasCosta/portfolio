        <h1>Projects</h1>

        <p> <span>Web Programming</span>  – The main objective of this project was to develop a Full-Stack
            web solution that would allow the creation of a website with information about 
            video games and a forum on the subject, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js/Express.js and MySQL.
        </p>

        <p> <span>Project of the Database Complements Course</span> which aims to familiarize with the administration of relational 
            databases using SQLServer, through the implementation of a new system for grouping schools named "Agrupamento STB". <br>
            One of the measures adopted by the group is to develop a new information system that allows it to manage, in an integrated way,
            the entire process of launching grades of the different schools in the grouping, as well as allowing students and guardians to
            have access to this information. <br>
            With the implementation of the new system, it became necessary to model and integrate, in a new Database, the pieces of information
            that were exported from existing systems and that up to now supported the various schools in the cluster. The main concepts used
            were Programming (Stored Procedures, Functions, Triggers), Metadata, Indexes, Backup and Recovery, Access levels, Encryption, and
            transaction control.
        </p>


        <p> <span>Java Advanced Programming</span>  - A logistics network consists of the location of the distribution centers and product movements between
            these centers when each route is bidirectional. This program consists of a graphical application in which the user views, manipulates, 
            and obtains diverse information about a logistics network. <br>
            Throughout the project, the following several abstract data types were used: ArrayList, HashMap, LinkedHashMap. We also used data types
            by us implemented as following shown: Graph, GraphAdjacencyList, Vertex and Edge. Referring to Design Patterns, we used: Observer Pattern,
            Strategy Pattern, MVC Pattern. We also used refactoring techniques to avoid bad smells in the program.
